\hangindent=2em  
\par I’m expected to receive my Econ PhD from Nanjing University in June 2024. My academic performance is excellent and I kept winning academic scholarships for many years. I naturally love exploring the world and doing research. I have a wide vision and my research interests focus on China economic issues，recessions and macroeconomics. I have already published a few dissertations for now as I list out in my resume.
\par I’m very skilled at economic analysis, data science. More importantly, I get the ability to think independently, which enables me to analyze and think more deeply about the nature of problems.
\par I have an optimistic and strong personality. I trust that my ability comes from long-term concentration and effort. For me the progress of science and technology is what make true value for human beings and I always think tomorrow will be better.I truly insist that what defines a person depends on his contribution to the world.I always follow the principle of being honesty and make everything open when I work, which makes communication simple and effective. I love to stay outside and embrace nature.Running, camping and swimming are my lifetime hobbies which make me energetic.
\par I’m ambitious and determined to be extraordinary. I know what it takes and I’ll embrace it with great passion.I look forward to showing myself to you face to face.
